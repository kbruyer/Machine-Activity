# Machine-Activity
This proposed capstone project will be named “Machine Activity Application”. It will be a proprietary web application for Northern Quest Resort & Casino which will be used primarily to capture data on the various technical issues encountered using their slot machines. The solutions will be captured as well so that a knowledge base can be created for use in the future when similar issues are encountered. This application will replace the inefficient SharePoint page currently in use. Additionally, this project will add a technical knowledge base and reporting, which is not currently available. It is important to note that a knowledge base is a living, breathing entity that, once brought forth, can only flourish and develop when supplied with data for nourishment, while nurtured in such a manner as to only provide clean, well-maintained information.
